### Credit Card Payments

#### PCI Compliance

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard \(PCI DSS\) is a set of security standards designed to ensure that ALL companies that accept, process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment.  
To learn more about PCI DSS compliance, visit [this FAQ](https://www.pcicomplianceguide.org/faq/), or visit the official [PCI website](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/).

#### Is your business Full PCI DSS compliant?

If your company is not Full PCI DSS compliant, you will not be able to handle credit card information on your servers. dLocal's Fields solution solves this problem, by letting you accept credit card payments right from your website, without worrying about PCI compliance.

If you **are** already PCI DSS compliant, we recommend you send dLocal the payment information directly server-to-server.
