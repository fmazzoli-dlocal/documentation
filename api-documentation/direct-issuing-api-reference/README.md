# Direct Issuing API Reference

## Overview

To start creating user accounts, you'll be using 3 main groups of services: 

1. Creating and managing user's accounts.
2. Sending and managing funds for those accounts.
3. Issuing prepaid cards, linked to the account balances.

### 1. Create and manage user accounts

The solution requires you to **create an account for each user you want to credit funds to**. 

Our API allows you to easily create and manage these accounts, which includes enabling or disabling them, or retrieving relevant account information such as the balance, status, or the owner's information. Follow the links below to learn more about these services: â€‹

{% page-ref page="manage-accounts/" %}

### 2. Manage funding

Once the account is created, you can easily **transfer funds to top up the user accounts in local currency**. You also get access to a wide variety of information retrieving services, including transfers information, retrieving an account's balance, and transaction history.

### 3. Create and issue cards

Direct Issuing allows you to **issue virtual and physical prepaid cards linked to the user's account**. The user will be able to use the cards to pay for anything online, but also to pay offline with the physical card. Refer to this section to learn more about the card creation service:
