# Assign PIN

dLocal provides a JavaScript library that enables you to **display sensitive card data in your application or web page while limiting your data security compliance burden**.

Our solution accomplishes this by rendering an iframe to **handle input or update of the card PIN field** on your web page while ensuring that you are compliant with PCI requirements.

#### **Start displaying PIN**

{% page-ref page="set-pin.md" %}

#### Offer the option to actualize PIN

{% page-ref page="update-pin.md" %}
