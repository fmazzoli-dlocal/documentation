# Manage accounts

This section will provide **insights on enabling and disabling accounts and getting account information**.

* For instance, if you need to rapidly disable an account due to suspicious behavior, the disable card function allows you to automatically do so. 
* You can also get exhaustive information about a specific account, including country, balance, status, owner information, and whether there is a card link to this account.
