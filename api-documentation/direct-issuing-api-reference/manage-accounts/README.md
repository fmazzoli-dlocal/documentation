# Manage accounts

Accounts can be managed with different functions and queries. This section will provide insights on enabling and disabling accounts and getting account information.

For instance, if you need to rapidly disable an account due to suspicious behavior, the disable card function allows you to automatically do so. You can also get exhaustive information about a specific account, including country, balance, status, owner information, and whether there is a card link to this account. Get more details in each service page:
