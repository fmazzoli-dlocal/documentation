# Manage funds

This section provides the necessary set of functions to manage user's funds and balances.

The operations are:

**Handle user top-up**. For this use our Payins solution.

{% page-ref page="../../payins-api-reference/payments/" %}

**Transfer funds**

* From [merchant to users](transfer-funds.md).
* User to bank account. _Coming soon with our Payout solution_. 

{% page-ref page="transfer-funds.md" %}

**And others**

{% page-ref page="retrieve-balance.md" %}

{% page-ref page="transaction-history.md" %}
