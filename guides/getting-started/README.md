### Sign Up

The first step is to create a new dLocal merchant account here: [https://merchant.dlocal.com/sign\_up](https://merchant.dlocal.com/sign_up)

After submitting information, you will receive a confirmation link from merchants@dlocal.com in your email address. Verify the link, and you are all set to access the panel.

### First sign in

Access the merchant panel through [https://merchant.dlocal.com/login](https://merchant.dlocal.com/login) using the email and password you set when signing up. You are now ready to operate in the Sandbox environment.
