# Initial Settings

Access _Integration &gt;&gt; Integration Settings_. The first thing you will see are the test credentials to be used for our Sandbox platform. We'll get to that later.

 Add the IP addresses you want to whitelist:

And input the Return, Confirmations and Refunds URLs:

When you are done with the previous settings, and before starting to test in Sandbox, you can start adding some business-related information.

Access _Settings &gt;&gt; Merchant Account_ and input information like company name, main contact information, bank accounts and more.

{% hint style="info" %}
Add as much information as you can. This will make communications in the future much smoother.
{% endhint %}

You can also start giving access to new users through _Settings &gt;&gt; Users_. Input the user email and set the level of access you want to assign them.
