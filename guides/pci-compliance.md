# PCI Compliance

## **Who must be PCI compliant?**

If you accept credit cards from your customers, then you **must** be PCI compliant.

Many payment gateways and online payment processing solutions may claim that their credit card widget excludes you from worrying about PCI compliance. This is not true. Even if you are using a third party to handle the collection, processing and storage of protected cardholder data, you must still follow the necessary certification process.

Third party solutions allow you to be PCI compliant with much less effort and expense than if you were processing and storing the card data yourself, but you still have to certify each year. Companies like dLocal can help reduce your PCI compliance burden, but no one can eliminate it entirely.

## **Proof of PCI Compliance**

What is required to prove your PCI compliance is ultimately up to your merchant/acquiring bank, and it depends on several factors, including the number of transactions you process annually. If you process fewer than 6 million transactions per scheme \(Visa, MasterCard\) per year, you may be able to self-assess by completing one of the PCI DSS Self-Assessment Questionnaire \(SAQ\); this is a self-assessment tool to assess security for cardholder data. 

Generally, however, if you are using dLocal you will rely on our PCI Level 1 status and complete the relevant SAQ.

## **How Do I Self-Assess?**

Performing a PCI compliance self-assessment requires you to complete a questionnaire and, depending on what self-assessment category you fall under, having an outside provider perform a quarterly security scan of your systems.

There are currently eight categories of self-assessment, but not all of these are applicable to online merchants. Your level of PCI scope will ultimately depend on how you capture and work with credit card data. If you are using a third party service like dLocal it is likely that you will be required to fill out either a SAQ A or SAQ D. View the table below for more information:

| IF YOUR SYSTEMS | THEN USE  | COMPLEXITY |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Do _not_ touch, process or store cardholder data, and do not serve any card collection forms \(e.g. you use dLocal’s [Smart Fields](../products/smart-fields/)\) | SAQ-A | Lowest |
| Do touch, process or store cardholder data | SAQ D | Highest |
