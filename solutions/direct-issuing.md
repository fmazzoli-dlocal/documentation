# Direct Issuing

Create new lines of revenue and easily issue prepaid cards in local currencies to reach millions of consumers in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

Issue company branded cards and send funds to cards directly to pay out partners such as drivers, homeowners or freelancers, or use it to manage loyalty programs with customers, vendors and employees. You can easily customize the card to your brand style and make funds in local currency available instantly to pay - online and offline.

The solution consists of creating an account for each user, crediting funds to this account's balance, and then issuing a pre-paid card that will be linked to that balance. The user will be able to use those funds to pay for anything, online or offline. 

Service also includes all the relevant card operations you may be thinking of, such as creating, blocking or cancelling a card.
