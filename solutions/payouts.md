# Payouts

Pay your partners in their local currency by depositing the funds directly to their banks account and help them avoid extra fees and taxes associated with foreign currency conversion. We are connected to all the key banks in every country we operate. Thatâ€™s over 200 banks!

Typical settlement times are 24-48 hours. That means your payouts recipients can access the funds quickly and securely using the financial infrastructure on which they rely daily.
